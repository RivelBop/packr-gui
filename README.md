# packr-gui
 packr-gui is a cross-platform Java Swing application used to export application/executable wrappers for JAR files. The purpose of packr-gui is to provide an alternate form of execution for JAR files by packing a JDK, instead of requiring users to have Java installed. This software is simply a wrapper of [packr](https://github.com/libgdx/packr "packr Github").
 ## Open Source
 You are free to use packr-gui to your liking, there is no need to provide credit. Apart from the GUI, all credit goes to [packr](https://github.com/libgdx/packr "packr Github").
